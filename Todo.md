# Introduction #

This is basically a list of things I have planned for eventually doing, in no particular order.


# Details #

  * Allow syncing with Simplenote.
  * Icons.
  * About screen.
  * Migrate to a toolbar instead of file menu, so is more crossplatform friendly.
  * Build packages for i386/x86\_64 debian, Mac OS X, and Windows.
  * Configuration options page.
  * ~~Allow docking to different areas of the screen.~~
  * Options for adjusting the window size (use percentage based).
  * Options for setting the hotkey.
  * ~~Allowing the markup that Simplenote allows.~~
  * ~~Making linewrap optional.~~
  * ~~Break out the scaling code into a separate function, so it could be called each time the window is made to appear (may potentially cause fewer glitches when shifting screen resolutions, and thus could in theory allow it to be used for games.~~

# Maybe #

These are items that may or may not be implemented, depending on interest, time, and difficulty.
  * Mouseover hotzone for triggering.
  * Fullscreen toggling, for those wanting it to use it as an editor and jump between reference and code views.
  * Toggling the always on top setting of the window
  * Transparency of the window.
  * Coloring backgrounds of different notes.
